## PRESS RELEASE

### RealWorth.ai Becomes the Operating System for the $500 Billion Collectibles Market

**AI-powered platform connects 10 million collectors, dealers, and buyers—turning forgotten items into discovered treasures**

**SAN FRANCISCO — January 2028** — RealWorth.ai today announced it has surpassed 10 million users, $2 billion in items appraised, and $50 million in annual marketplace transactions, cementing its position as the leading platform for discovering, valuing, and selling collectibles, antiques, and personal treasures.

#### The Problem

Americans own an estimated $500 billion in collectibles, antiques, and valuable items—most of which sit forgotten in attics, basements, and storage units. The average household has $4,000 in hidden value they don't even know about. When people do decide to sell, they face a fragmented, confusing market:

- **No idea what it's worth**: Professional appraisals cost $50-300 per item and take days
- **No idea where to sell**: eBay? Auction house? Dealer? Garage sale? Each has different buyers and fees
- **No idea who to trust**: Fakes, lowball offers, and scams plague the industry
- **No easy way to track value**: Collectors have no portfolio view of their holdings

The result? Billions in value never gets realized. Family heirlooms get donated or thrown away. Collectors can't make informed decisions about their investments.

#### The Solution

RealWorth.ai solves this with AI-powered instant appraisals and a trust-verified marketplace that connects the right sellers with the right buyers.

**For Collectors**: Point your phone at any item and get an instant, accurate valuation with market references. Track your collection's value over time. Get alerts when prices move. Know exactly what you own and what it's worth.

**For Sellers**: One tap turns any appraisal into a marketplace listing with AI-optimized pricing. Choose your channel: local pickup, dealer network, or auction-style bidding. Verified buyers, secure payments, 2.5% fees (vs. 13% on eBay).

**For Dealers**: Source inventory from the largest verified seller network in the industry. Bulk assessment tools scan entire estates in minutes. White-glove consignment for high-value items.

**For Enterprises**: Insurance companies use our certificates for claims. Auction houses integrate our API for intake. Estate attorneys recommend us to executors.

#### By the Numbers

- **10 million** registered users across iOS, Android, and web
- **$2 billion** total value of items appraised
- **500,000** marketplace transactions completed
- **10,000+** verified dealers in the network
- **95%** appraisal accuracy (validated against auction results)
- **$50 million** annual GMV (Gross Merchandise Value)
- **4.8 stars** average app store rating

#### Customer Testimonial

> "I inherited my grandmother's estate and had no idea where to start. RealWorth appraised 200 items in one weekend. Three of them turned out to be worth over $5,000 each—items I was going to donate. The marketplace connected me with a dealer who bought the entire collection. What would have taken months took two weeks. I can't imagine doing this without RealWorth."
>
> — **Sarah M., Portland, OR** (Estate executor)

#### Dealer Testimonial

>
> — **David Chen**, Owner, Pacific Northwest Antiques

### Technical FAQs

**Q: How does the AI appraisal work?**

A: Multi-stage pipeline:

1. **Image analysis**: Vision model identifies item category, maker, era, materials
2. **Condition assessment**: Detects wear, damage, restoration, authenticity markers
3. **Market lookup**: Cross-references 50M+ completed sales from auction databases
4. **Price synthesis**: Weighted algorithm considering condition, rarity, demand trends
5. **Confidence scoring**: Returns price range + confidence level (0-100)

The system improves continuously through feedback loops:
- User corrections ("This is actually a 1st edition")
- Completed sales data ("Item sold for $X")
- Expert validations ("Appraiser confirmed $X")

A:
