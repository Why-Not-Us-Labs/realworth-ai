  - `realworth.ai/privacy`
  - `realworth.ai/terms`
  - `realworth.ai/support`
- [ ] **Test Support Email:** Send a test email to `support@whynotus.ai` to ensure you receive it.

### App Store Connect Setup:

- [ ] **Set Up In-App Purchases:**
  - Go to `App Store Connect > Your App > Subscriptions`.
  - Create a new subscription group.
  - Add your subscription levels (e.g., Monthly, Annual, Lifetime) with the pricing we discussed.

## Phase 2: Build & Asset Collection (Once App is Ready)

These tasks require a testable build from Claude Code.

- [ ] **Get Screenshots:** Claude Code will provide you with screenshots for the required device sizes (6.7" and 6.5").

- [ ] **Upload App Icon:** Upload your 1024x1024 app icon in the same section.

## Phase 3: Final Review & Testing (Critical Pre-Launch Step)

This is your final sign-off before the app goes to Apple.

- [ ] **Get TestFlight Build:** Ask Claude Code to send you an invitation to test the app via TestFlight.
- [ ] **Install and Test Thoroughly:** Install the app on your own iPhone and test every feature:
  - [ ] Can you create an account?
  - [ ] Can you perform an appraisal?
  - [ ] Does the AI chat work?
  - [ ] Can you create a collection?
  - [ ] Do the Discover and Leaderboard feeds work?
- [ ] **Verify Legal Compliance:**
  - [ ] Check that the appraisal disclaimer is clearly visible.
  - [ ] Go to the Settings screen and confirm the links to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service work.
  - [ ] **Test Account Deletion.** Go through the entire process of deleting your test account from within the app and confirm it works as expected. This is a major Apple requirement.

## Phase 4: Launch Prep & Submission

- [ ] **Marketing Prep:**
  - Start filming your "Treasure Reveal" TikTok videos.
  - Prepare your social media announcements for launch day.
- [ ] **Final Review of App Store Listing:** Read through your Promotional Text and Description one last time.
- [ ] **Click "Submit for Review":** Once everything is complete and tested, you are the one who clicks the final button in App Store Connect to send the app to Apple for review.

### After Submission:

*   **Wait for Review:** Apple's review process can take anywhere from a day to a week.
*   **Respond to Apple:** If Apple's review team has questions, they will contact you via the App Store Connect resolution center. Respond promptly.
