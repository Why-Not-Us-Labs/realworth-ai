### 2. Service and Appraisals

Our Service provides AI-powered appraisals of items based on images you provide. **PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.**

#### A. Appraisals Are Estimates Only

> **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:** The valuations provided by RealWorth.ai are **estimates only** and are provided for **informational and entertainment purposes**. They are NOT certified appraisals and should NOT be relied upon as the definitive value of any item.

You understand and agree that:

*   **Estimates, Not Guarantees:** All valuations are estimates based on AI analysis of available market data. We **cannot and do not guarantee** that any item is worth the amount displayed. Actual market value may be significantly higher or lower than our estimate.

*   **Not a Substitute for Professional Appraisal:** RealWorth.ai is **NOT a substitute for a professional, certified appraiser**. If you need an accurate valuation for insurance, estate planning, sale, legal proceedings, tax purposes, or any other official or financial purpose, **you must consult a qualified, licensed appraiser**.

*   **No Liability for Valuation Accuracy:** We are **not liable** for any loss, damage, or claim arising from your reliance on our estimates. This includes, but is not limited to: selling an item for less than its actual value, insuring an item for an incorrect amount, making financial decisions based on our estimates, or any disputes arising from the use of our valuations.

*   **Continuous Improvement:** We continuously train and update our AI models to provide the most consistent and fair estimates based on available data. However, no AI system is perfect, and valuations can vary based on factors we cannot assess, such as condition, provenance, authenticity, and current market demand.

*   **Factors We Cannot Assess:** Our AI analyzes images and text you provide. It cannot physically inspect items, verify authenticity, assess condition beyond what is visible in photos, or account for regional market variations. A professional appraiser can assess these factors in person.

#### B. AI Processing

By using the appraisal feature, you grant us the right to use the images and text you submit to provide the service, which includes processing by third-party AI services as outlined in our Privacy Policy.

By posting User Content to the Service, you grant us the right and license to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and distribute such User Content on and through the Service. You retain any and all of your rights to any User Content you submit.

You represent and warrant that: (i) the User Content is yours (you own it) or you have the right to use it and grant us the rights and license as provided in these Terms, and (ii) the posting of your User Content on or through the Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights or any other rights of any person.

### 4. Subscriptions

*   **Payment:** Your subscription will be charged through your Apple App Store or Google Play Store account, or via our third-party payment processor Stripe on our website.
*   **Renewal:** At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or we cancel it.
*   **Cancellation:** You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting the respective app store's support team.
*   **Fee Changes:** We reserve the right to modify the Subscription fees at any time. Any fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
