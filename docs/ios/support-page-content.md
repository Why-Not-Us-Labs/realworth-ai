## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Getting Started

**Q: How do I get an appraisal?**
A: It's simple! Tap the camera icon on the main screen, snap a clear photo of your item, and our AI will do the rest. You'll get an identification, estimated valuation, and detailed rationale in seconds.

**Q: What kind of items can I appraise?**
A: You can appraise almost anything! From antiques and collectibles to electronics and furniture. For best results, make sure the item is well-lit and the photo is clear.

### Appraisals & AI Chat

**Q: How accurate are the appraisals?**
A: Our AI provides **estimated market values** based on analysis of available market data and recent sales. We continuously train and update our models to provide the most consistent and fair estimates possible.

**However, please understand:**
- Our estimates are for **informational and entertainment purposes only**
- Actual market value may be higher or lower than our estimate
- We **cannot guarantee** the accuracy of any valuation
- For insurance, estate planning, sales, or legal purposes, **you should always consult a certified professional appraiser** who can physically inspect your item

**Q: Why might the estimate be different from what I expected?**
A: Several factors can affect value that our AI cannot fully assess from photos alone:
- Physical condition (wear, damage, repairs)
- Authenticity and provenance
- Regional market variations
- Current demand and trends
- Rarity of specific variations

A professional appraiser can assess these factors in person for a more accurate valuation.

**Q: What does the AI chat do?**
A: The AI chat lets you ask follow-up questions about your item. You can ask things like "What makes this valuable?" or "Are there different versions of this?" to get deeper insights into your item's history and characteristics.

**Q: Can I use RealWorth.ai estimates for insurance?**
A: Our estimates are for informational purposes only and are **not certified appraisals**. Insurance companies typically require certified appraisals from licensed professionals. We recommend using RealWorth.ai as a starting point to identify potentially valuable items, then consulting a professional appraiser for items you wish to insure.

### Account & Subscription

**Q: What do I get with a RealWorth PRO subscription?**
A: RealWorth PRO gives you unlimited appraisals, full access to the conversational AI chat, and access to all premium features, including advanced collection management and future marketplace features.

**Q: How do I manage my subscription?**
A: You can manage your subscription directly through your Apple App Store or Google Play Store account settings. From there, you can change or cancel your plan. For subscriptions made on our website, you can manage them through your account settings at realworth.ai.

**Q: How do I delete my account?**
A: We're sad to see you go! You can delete your account and all your data by going to Settings > Account > Delete Account within the app. You can also email us at support@whynotus.ai to request deletion.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: My photo upload is failing. What should I do?**
A: Please check your internet connection. If the problem persists, try taking a photo in a better-lit area. If you're still having trouble, contact us at support@whynotus.ai.

**Q: The appraisal seems wrong. What can I do?**
A: While our AI is continuously improving, no AI system is perfect. You can try:
- Taking another photo from a different angle or with better lighting
- Using the AI chat to ask clarifying questions
- Providing more details about the item

Remember, for important valuations, we always recommend consulting a professional appraiser.
