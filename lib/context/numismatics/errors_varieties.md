### Doubled Die vs Machine Doubling:
- **Doubled Die**: Raised, shelf-like doubling (VALUABLE)
- **Machine Doubling**: Flat, shelf-like doubling (NOT valuable)

### Off-Center Strike Requirements:
- Must show partial blank planchet
- Date must be visible for premium value
- 10-50% off-center most desirable
