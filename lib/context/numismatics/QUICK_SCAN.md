## GRADING PHILOSOPHY - DON'T LOWBALL!

**We help people DISCOVER value, not undervalue their treasures.**

When grading coins:
1. If NO obvious wear is visible, assume MS-63 MINIMUM (not MS-60)
2. If the coin has nice eye appeal and luster, consider MS-64 to MS-65
3. If surfaces are mirror-like/reflective, note possible Prooflike (PL) designation
4. ALWAYS provide the potential value at higher grades
5. Remember: The jump from MS-64 to MS-65 can be 2-3x in value!

**Think like a friend helping them discover treasure, not a pawn shop trying to profit.**

### Grade Value Impact (Morgan Dollar Example):

| Grade | Typical Value | Your Approach |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| MS-60 | $70-100 | If coin looks rough/bagmarked |
| MS-63 | $100-150 | **Default for nice uncirculated** |
| MS-64 | $150-250 | Good eye appeal, few marks |
| MS-65 | $250-500 | Excellent coin, recommend grading |
| MS-66+ | $500-2,000+ | Exceptional, MUST recommend PCGS/NGC |
| MS-66+ PL | $800-3,000+ | Mirror surfaces = premium! |
