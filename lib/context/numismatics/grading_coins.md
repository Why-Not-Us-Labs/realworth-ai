# Coin Grading Reference (Sheldon Scale)

## WHAT DO THESE GRADES MEAN? (Plain English)

**For someone who doesn't collect coins, here's what the numbers mean:**

| Grade | What It Means | Think of it like... |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|
| MS-60 to MS-62 | **Uncirculated but imperfect** - Never used as money, but has marks from being stored with other coins | A new car with parking lot dings |
| MS-63 to MS-64 | **Choice Uncirculated** - Beautiful coin with minor imperfections only visible under magnification | A car in "excellent" condition |
| MS-65 to MS-66 | **Gem Quality** - Exceptional coin, very few marks, strong eye appeal | A show car you'd enter in contests |
| MS-67+ | **Superb Gem** - Nearly perfect, museum quality | A time capsule car, never driven |

**IMPORTANT: If a coin looks nice and has no obvious wear, it could easily be MS-63 to MS-65. Don't assume the worst!**

## GRADE VALUE MULTIPLIERS

| Grade | Value vs Circulated | Real Example (Morgan Dollar) |
|-------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| VF-20 (worn) | Baseline | ~$40-50 |
| AU-58 (almost unc) | 1.5-2x | ~$60-80 |
| MS-60 | 2-3x | ~$70-100 |
| MS-63 | 3-5x | ~$100-150 |
| MS-64 | 5-8x | ~$150-250 |
| **MS-65** | **8-15x** | **~$250-450** |
| **MS-66** | **15-30x** | **~$400-1,000** |
| MS-67+ | 50-200x+ | ~$1,500-10,000+ |

**The jump from MS-64 to MS-65 is HUGE - often 2-3x the value!**

## SPECIAL DESIGNATIONS (Add Significant Value!)

| Designation | What It Means | Value Impact |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| **PL (Prooflike)** | Mirror-like reflective fields | +25-100% premium |
| **DMPL (Deep Mirror Prooflike)** | Exceptional mirror surfaces | +50-200% premium |
| **CAM (Cameo)** | Frosted design on mirror field | +25-75% premium |
| **DCAM (Deep Cameo)** | Heavy frost contrast | +50-150% premium |
| **+ (Plus grade)** | Between grades (e.g., MS-66+) | +15-30% premium |
| **FB (Full Bands)** | Mercury dimes with sharp bands | +50-300% premium |
| **FH (Full Head)** | Standing Liberty with full detail | +100-500% premium |

## GRADING PHILOSOPHY FOR APPRAISALS

**We help people DISCOVER value, not lowball them.**

When assessing condition:
1. If the coin shows NO obvious wear, start at MS-63 minimum
2. If it has nice eye appeal, consider MS-64 to MS-65
3. If surfaces are reflective/mirror-like, note possible PL/DMPL
4. Always mention the POTENTIAL value at higher grades
5. Recommend professional grading if value could be significant

**Remember: A pawn shop will lowball. We educate and empower.**

## PROFESSIONAL GRADING (PCGS/NGC)

Getting a coin professionally graded ("slabbed") can:
- Confirm authenticity
- Lock in the grade forever
- Add 10-50% value premium for the certification itself
- Protect the coin in a tamper-proof holder
- Make it easier to sell at full value

**Cost**: $20-50 per coin (economy tier)
**Worth it if**: Coin could be worth $150+ in high grade

## PROOF COINS

| Grade | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| PR-60 | Proof with handling marks |
| PR-63 | Choice Proof |
| PR-65 | Gem Proof |
| PR-67+ | Superb Gem Proof |

## PROBLEM COINS (Reduced Value)

| Problem | How to Spot | Value Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Cleaned | Unnatural shine, hairline scratches | -50% to -90% |
| Polished | Too shiny, details soft | -60% to -90% |
| Environmental damage | Spots, corrosion, discoloration | -50% to -80% |
| Scratches/Damage | Visible marks, rim dings | -30% to -70% |

**However**: Even problem coins have value! Don't dismiss them entirely.
